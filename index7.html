    <p>Chicken Tikka is a flavorful and aromatic dish made from marinated pieces of chicken that are skewered and grilled to perfection. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, along with garlic and ginger, which helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with rich flavors. The marinade not only enhances the taste but also gives the chicken its vibrant color. Once grilled, the chicken pieces are slightly charred, giving them a smoky flavor, while remaining juicy and tender inside. Served with naan or rice and accompanied by a side of mint chutney, chicken tikka is a popular dish in Indian cuisine, loved for its bold and spicy taste.</p>
